# Red-vs-Blue-Team
vulnerability assessment, pentesting, SOC and reporting.

In this project, I played both pentesting and SOC analyst roles. I attacked a VM hosting a company's website and eventually gained root access to it. I ensured log agents were installed on the VM to send logs to ELK. I used Kibana to analyze the log data and created visualizations for my final report.

Lastly, I created a report to document all my findings incuding all vulnerabilities and 
successful exploits along with their corresponding mitigation strategies. Checkout the uploaded pdf for full presentation.
